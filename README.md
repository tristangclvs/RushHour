Little Rush Hour game on graphical interface. University Project.

## How to play

You must download all the files and put them in the same directory :  
- rush.ini contains all the different levels of the game.  
- ez.CLI and ez.TK are libraries used to create the game.  

When you run the Main file, you need to pick the level you want between 01 and 40.  Then, the map will generate and you will be able to move the cars by clicking on one of the edges.
